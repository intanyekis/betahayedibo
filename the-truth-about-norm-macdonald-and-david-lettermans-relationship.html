The former Late Show host and stand-up comedian is as reclusive as they come. Not only that, but he is hilariously uncomfortable with public displays of affection. But many celebrities have done everything they can to have a relationship with David due to the fact that they adore him, respect him, and find him hilarious. This includes<a href=#> Star Wars</a>' Mark Hamill, <a href=#>who grew up idolizing David</a>, and one of David's most frequent Late-Night Guests,<a href=#> radio legend Howard Stern</a>. But there was probably no one who admired David Letterman as much as the late Norm Macdonald.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Canadian comedian recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lost his life after privately fighting cancer </a>for nine years. So much about Norm's life was kept to himself. After all, he was nearly as reclusive as David Letterman. And yet, throughout his life, Norm had expressed some truly beautiful sentiments about the late-night talk show host. Here's the truth about their relationship...</p><h2 id=they-had-no-private-relationship-but-david-held-a-very-important-position-in-norm-39-s-life>They Had No Private Relationship But David Held A Very Important Position In Norm's Life</h2><p>Because of David Letterman's reclusive nature, Norm Macdonald never actually had a private relationship with him. However, the two built as close of a connection as possible through his many appearances on The Late Show. During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2016 interview</a> on The <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show, Norm spoke at length about his experience on talk shows. While he initially got the opportunity to appear on The Tonight Show, he really found a home on The Late Show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>That Time SNL Fired Norm MacDonald...

"And then he said the ultimate compliment, 'There may be people as funny as Norm but I don't know anybody funnier.' That had to floor you, right? That meant something?"</p><p>"Yeah, that'll buckle your knees."</p><p>The connection between Norm and Dave was palpable. And their respect was mutual. So much so that Dave asked Norm to be the last stand-up comedian to perform on his show before he retired from his hosting duties in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After doing his final set on The Late Show With David Letterman, Norm took a moment to say a few kind words about the host. In his speech, Norm began to break down and explained the true impact that David has had on his career.</p><p>"We all know that David Letterman was the greatest talk show host that ever lived," Norm said to the audience while aggressively holding back tears. "I remember Dave differently because the first time I saw him I was 13-years-old and I was living in --- I was living in Toronto, Canada, and I went to a talk show they had there and David Letterman was the stand-up comedian on the show. And I loved stand-up. And David Letterman did this joke that I loved this joke. I tell everybody this joke. It still stays with me as my favorite stand-up joke ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After performing the joke, Norm went on to explain how much he loved David. By the end of this heartfelt moment, Norm was in tears and the ever-uncomfortable David came down to embrace him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside David Letterman's 34 Year Long Relationship With Wife, Regina Lasko</a></span></p><p>In his interview with Howard Stern, Norm admitted that he had no intention to go out and be that sentimental. "I wanted to say something, but it wasn't that," Norm explained. Following Norm's touching moment, David whispered something private in his ear. Norm told Howard that it was incredibly touching and something that he'd remember for the rest of his life.</p><p>"Although I have no backstage experience with [David] at all, just the things he's talked to me about in-between commercials and stuff like that, I always felt so close to him. I really felt like he was a type of father figure. That he was my father figure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-39-s-feelings-about-norm>David's Feelings About Norm</h2><p>When Norm passed away, countless comedians shared their personal experiences and feelings about the Canadian comic. Among the many public eulogies was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one from David Letterman</a>.</p><p>"In every important way, in the world of stand-up, Norm was the best," David said. "An opinion shared by me and all peers. Always up to something, never certain, until his matter-of-fact delivery leveled you. I was always delighted by his bizarre mind and earnest gaze. (I’m trying to avoid using the phrase, ‘twinkle in his eyes’). He was a lifetime Cy Young winner in comedy. Gone, but impossible to forget."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While their relationship wasn't one of shared dinners, golf games, or weddings, it was deeply authentic in their own way. There's no doubt that David, like many of Norm's fans, will deeply miss him forever.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Top 10 Most Awkward David Letterman Interviews Ever</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6r7vRpmSmmZOZvK%2Bty51kmqaUYrGiwsidZKWdpKmys7nAp6pmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-norm-macdonald-and-david-lettermans-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-truth-about-norm-macdonald-and-david-lettermans-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-norm-macdonald-and-david-lettermans-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-truth-about-norm-macdonald-and-david-lettermans-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-norm-macdonald-and-david-lettermans-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-norm-macdonald-and-david-lettermans-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wisdom-kaye-height-age-wiki-biograophy-girlfriend-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wisdom-kaye-height-age-wiki-biograophy-girlfriend-net-worth.html>Wisdom Kaye Height, Age, Wiki, Biograophy, Girlfriend, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mary-higgins-clark-net-worth.html>Mary Higgins Clark Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mary-higgins-clark-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
