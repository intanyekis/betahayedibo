<time>16 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Starring in a franchise film is something many performers hope to do one day, as this can lead to&nbsp;some other huge opportunities and net them a massive paycheck in the process. Whether it is in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a></strong>, or with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DC</a>, these franchises find ways to domain the at the box office and reward their stars accordingly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mark Hamill has been an actor for several decades now, and while he has done many amazing things, he will always be best known for his time as&nbsp;Luke Skywalker. The young kid from Tatooine that saved the galaxy is one of the most iconic characters in history, and Hamill has built on this legacy through the years.</p><p>So, how much was Hamill paid to play Luke Skywalker? Let’s find out!</p><h2 id=he-made-650-000-for-a-new-hope>He Made $650,000 For A New Hope</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50664934-969A-4A54-BBA2-1FD6960A6032.jpeg><p>To get the full picture on how much Mark Hamill made to star as Luke Skywalker, we need to head back to the very beginning of it all. It may be easy to look at what&nbsp;Star Wars has become and assume that Hamill netted himself a huge salary, but no one knew what the franchise was going to be before&nbsp;A New Hope came out and changed the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this time, Hamill had yet to appear in a single movie. Instead, all of his credits to that point came on the small screen, meaning that&nbsp;A New Hope was, in fact, his first major film, according to&nbsp;IMDb. Even though he was not a film star, he was still able to secure the role of Luke Skywalker.</p><p>For his role in the film, Hamill scored himself a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$650,000</a> payday. By today’s standards, that is quite a bit for a first franchise film, so he must have been thrilled to have landed that type of money. For comparison, Chris Hemsworth was paid $150,000 for the first&nbsp;Thor film, according to&nbsp;Hindustan Times. That seems like a shocking number, but he wound up making millions down the line for playing Thor.</p><p>Turns out, the investment in Hamill as the lead character wound up paying dividends for George Lucas and the folks making&nbsp;A New Hope.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;IMDb, that film would go on to gross $775 million during its time at the box office, making for an incredible success and genuinely changing the movie industry forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About The Failed ‘Star Wars: Underworld’ Series</a></span></p><h2 id=he-had-a-nice-incentive-in-his-contract>He Had A Nice Incentive In His Contract</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/423579A2-1AB4-467F-995A-E1F4AF5E4818.png><p>As nice as it was that Hamill was given a pretty solid salary for his time in&nbsp;A New Hope, there was some that thought that he wound up being underpaid for the film. After all, that first film did start arguably the most important franchise in film history and it has been nothing short of iconic.</p><p>However, the base salary that has been reported for Hamill does not tell the full story. According to&nbsp;Men’s Health, the actor was also able to net himself a portion of the film’s profits, which was certainly in the millions. This, naturally, proved to be a huge boost to the actor’s base pay and certainly helped his net worth. At this time, there is no official number for what he made from the profits alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There would be two more films in the original trilogy of&nbsp;Star Wars flicks, and at this time, Hamill’s salary is unknown for those movies. It should be noted that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> does show an increase in pay from one movie to the next for Harrison Ford, so it is entirely possible that Hamill’s salary followed a similar pattern.</p><p>Hamill did not appear in the prequel trilogy, as his character wasn’t born during that time, but he did make a triumphant return in the modern sequel trilogy, making himself some stacks in the process.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are ‘Star Wars’ Actors Adam Driver And Domhnall Gleeson</a></span></p><h2 id=he-made-seven-figures-for-the-sequel-films>He Made Seven Figures For The Sequel Films</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/F3771CD9-407E-4B96-835A-D19FEA04D763.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the modern sequel films, Hamill&nbsp;may not have been the lead like he was in the past, but he did make a contribution to each film. Fans were unbelievably excited to see him back in action, and you had better believe that he was compensated for his time.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Men’s Health, Hamill was paid somewhere between $1-3 million for his efforts in&nbsp;The Force Awakens alone. Keep in mind that in the film, he was essentially paid to stand there and remove his hood.</p><p>His salary for the other sequel films are not known, but he played a much bigger part in&nbsp;The Last Jedi,&nbsp;so it’s entirely possible that he was able to increase his salary from one film to the next.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Actors Who Could Play Luke Skywalker Today</a></span></p><p>Mark Hamill is as iconic as it gets in the world of film, and it’s nice to see that he has made a mint by playing Luke Skywalker.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Does Keira Knightley Think About Acting In ‘Star Wars’?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiYsSivtJmn6ivXaLCpLSMnaCdZZ2Wv6x5x5qkoqScYrqit8Rmq6hloKGuunnLrqKeZaOgxrity6Scq2c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstar-wars-how-much-did-mark-hamill-make-to-play-luke-skywalker.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstar-wars-how-much-did-mark-hamill-make-to-play-luke-skywalker.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstar-wars-how-much-did-mark-hamill-make-to-play-luke-skywalker.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstar-wars-how-much-did-mark-hamill-make-to-play-luke-skywalker.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstar-wars-how-much-did-mark-hamill-make-to-play-luke-skywalker.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstar-wars-how-much-did-mark-hamill-make-to-play-luke-skywalker.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./12-awesome-christmas-movies-children-shouldnt-watch.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./12-awesome-christmas-movies-children-shouldnt-watch.html>12 Awesome Christmas Movies Children Shouldn't Watch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-bio-net-worth-married-husband-kids-movies-songs-age.html>What Is the Net Worth of Jennifer Love Hewitt ?
