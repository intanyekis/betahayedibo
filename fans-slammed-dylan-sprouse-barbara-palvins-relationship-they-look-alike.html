However, the majority of the photos of Sprouse and Palvin show exactly what everyone is talking about.

In many cases, the videos that pop up will have people in them using the latest social media trends to draw attention to the couple's similar looks.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it is important to note that it isn't just fans on TikTok that are <strong>drawing attention to Sprouse and Palvin's looks</strong>. One example of that is that a post on a pop culture subreddit about Sprouse and Palvin getting engaged included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responses focused on their looks</a>.</p><p>One Reddit response to the news reads, "I mean this more of a joke, but they look so much alike and you know what they say about couples that look alike ðŸ˜‚" If that wasn't amazing enough, one responder disputed that Sprouse and Palvin looked alike.
