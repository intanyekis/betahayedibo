It is quite difficult to nail down the Top 10 Nas songs because there are so many.&nbsp;</p><p>With a career that now spans over three decades and still going strong, Nas has longevity, street cred, immense lyrical content, and unbeatable emcee skills. So, here is handpicked selection of the&nbsp;<strong>best Nas songs</strong>&nbsp;that are like a journey through Hip-Hop history.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oldtimemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top-10-Nas-Songs.png alt="Top 10 Nas Songs" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Top_10_Nas_Songs></span>Top 10 Nas Songs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_If_I_Ruled_the_World_feat_Lauryn_Hill></span><code>#1</code> If I Ruled the World&nbsp;(feat. Lauryn Hill)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“If I Ruled the World” was a single that was released from his second studio album,&nbsp;It Was Written, in 1996. It’s widely regarded as one of, if not the&nbsp;<strong>greatest Nas song of all time</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>It featured Lauryn Hill vocals on the chorus, who, at the time, was making big waves as part of The Fugees. Although the beat might appear a bit minimalist and stripped-down, it was perfect for his flow. And, boy, did Nasty Nas flow on this track.</p><p>The lyrics are essentially Nas talking about what he would do if he ruled the world. Off the back of his first album, Nas was the&nbsp;<strong>hottest thing in rap music</strong>&nbsp;at the time. And, when this track dropped, everyone lost their minds in the best possible way. It’s just a shame that&nbsp;It Was Written&nbsp;didn’t quite live up to the quality of his debut album. But not many rap albums by anyone ever came close to that classic.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_NY_State_of_Mind></span><code>#2</code> N.Y. State of Mind<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This is the first track on the classic&nbsp;Illmatic&nbsp;album and was, for many, the first time they heard Nas. It’s one of the&nbsp;<strong>greatest rap tunes ever</strong>&nbsp;conceived in terms of the beat and the unbelievable lyrical content and flow.&nbsp;</p><p>“N.Y. State of Mind” was produced by the legendary DJ Premier. It’s a street track where Nas skillfully weaves his way through an entire story about a day in the life of the harsh Queensbridge ghetto in New York.</p><p><strong>If you are a real rap music fan from the boom-bap era…</strong></p><p>Then, you can probably recite at least the first verse word for word.&nbsp;“I never sleep because sleep is the cousin of death”&nbsp;is quite possibly one of the&nbsp;<strong>best rap lyrics and anecdotes ever written</strong>&nbsp;by a Hip-Hop emcee.&nbsp;</p><p>This song is even considered a true literary work to be held alongside the greatest poetic works in Western history. It’s the sort of track that is studied in college. If you’ve never heard it before, you are doing yourself a disservice.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_Nas_is_Like></span><code>#3</code> Nas is Like<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Nas is Like” might not be from his first couple of albums, but it stands up against any track he ever made. Again, DJ Premier was on the production, and, boy, what a memorable track this is.&nbsp;</p><p>Listening to Nas rap is like taking a course in street poetry. When younger rap fans try to say that Lil Wayne or Drake is the greatest rapper ever, just play this track because it’s on another level. Furthermore, it’s like a completely different sport to rap music in the 2010s, so it shouldn’t even be compared.</p><p>It was the first single from his 1999 album,&nbsp;I Am, which did very well in a commercial sense. But the truth is that Nas is not particularly a commercial artist. When the track dropped, it was like the rapper was back to his very best after being quiet for a couple of years. The king came back to claim his throne.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4_One_Love></span><code>#4</code> One Love<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When I think about the&nbsp;<strong>best songs by Nas</strong>, I simply cannot overlook “One Love” from the&nbsp;Illmatic&nbsp;album. It’s one of the most real and heartfelt Hip-Hop songs ever, bar none.&nbsp;</p><p>It was produced by Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest, who also sang the famous chorus hook. The dreamy and atmospheric jazz-style beat with its soothing xylophone sample touches me somewhere deep in my soul. Everyone says “one love” nowadays, but before Nas, I’d only heard it said by Bob Marley.</p><p>The concept of the track is Nas writing a letter to a friend locked up in prison. He tells his friend about what’s going on back at home in the ghetto and even warns him about his girl talking shit about him behind his back. The lyrics are so deep and meaningful. Nothing like this had ever been done before. And even today, I still get goosebumps when it’s played.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_The_World_is_Yours></span><code>#5</code> The World is Yours<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“The World is Yours” was the second single from his&nbsp;Illmatic&nbsp;album. It was produced by another legendary New York Hip-Hop producer, Pete Rock, who also sang the hook on the chorus.&nbsp;</p><p>The song title was inspired by the legendary words seen on a Goodyear blimp by Tony Montana (Al Pacino) in the infamous gangster movie&nbsp;Scarface. The movie and the track are now both cemented in the annuls of popular culture history, so that should be an indication of its greatness.</p><p>Nas once again flexed his lyrical genius and earth-shattering flows on this track. It’s one of the&nbsp;<strong>most memorable Nas songs</strong>&nbsp;from one of the&nbsp;<strong>most memorable rap albums of all time</strong>. The praise and kudos don’t get any bigger than that. It’s a boom-bap rap classic that is up there with all the best rap songs from the 1990s.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=6_Got_Ur_Self_a_Gun></span><code>#6</code> Got Ur Self a Gun<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>If you loved the title track from the ground-breaking HBO series “The Sopranos,” you’ll love “Got Ur Self a Gun,” which sampled that exact song for its chorus hook. When Nas spits street poetry over hardcore rap beats like this banger, it can cause power outages in Central America. It was released in 2001 from his&nbsp;Stillmatic&nbsp;album and was the standout tune, in my opinion.</p><p>The spooky piano sample, the hard snapping beats, and the picture-perfect rhymes made this an instant favorite with rap music fans. Even today, it’s still considered one of the&nbsp;<strong>best songs written by Nas</strong>. Should it be this high on a list of the top 10 Nas songs? Maybe not, but I had to break the monopoly of&nbsp;Illmatic&nbsp;tracks to balance things up a bit.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=7_It_Aint_Hard_To_Tell></span><code>#7</code> It Ain’t Hard To Tell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“It Ain’t Hard To Tell” was one of the original singles from&nbsp;Illmatic&nbsp;that informed the world of his talent. It famously sampled Michal Jackson’s “Human Nature” and even has a cameo from his dad playing the horns on the outro part of the track.&nbsp;</p><p>The swirling jazzy beat makes you drift off to another dimension while Nas flexes his emcee skills in unbeatable fashion. “I drop that ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block” is one of my favorite rap lyrics ever.&nbsp;</p><p>The beat was produced by Large Professor from Main Source fame. In my opinion, he is one of the most underrated and influential rap beatmakers of all time. If you were unsure about Nas at the time, when this single dropped just before&nbsp;Illmatic, we quickly realized that we had a rap prodigy on our hands. And, boy, were we correct.</p>&nbsp;<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=8_Verbal_Intercourse_feat_Raekwon_and_Ghostface_Killah></span><code>#8</code> Verbal Intercourse&nbsp;(feat. Raekwon and Ghostface Killah)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>If you are a true Nas fan like me, you will already know about “Verbal Intercourse” from Raekwon’s classic&nbsp;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx&nbsp;album&nbsp;in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>The track featured Nas, Raekwon, and Ghostface Killah and is known as one of the&nbsp;<strong>greatest rap songs of all time</strong>&nbsp;from the boom-bap era. Nas is first up on the track, and he kills it like Jeffry Dahmer. Some even think this is not only the greatest Nas verse ever, but the&nbsp;<strong>best rap verse ever spit</strong>, and I won’t argue that.</p><p>The beat is grimy, as you would expect from the Wu-Tang Clan. And the verses from these three legendary rappers are Hip-Hop porn of the highest caliber. The things Nas says in this verse are iconic, and the entire tune is already considered a classic. On a side note, this Raekwon album is also considered a&nbsp;<strong>Top-10 Rap album of all time</strong>&nbsp;if you are in the mood for a bit of Hip-Hop history.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=9_I_Can></span><code>#9</code> I Can<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“I Can” is #1 on most people’s top 10 Nas songs ever. But, in terms of greatness, it only just makes this list, in my opinion. Sure, it was probably&nbsp;<strong>Nas’s biggest song</strong>&nbsp;in terms of commercial success. And I can see why it’s usually placed in the top spot.&nbsp;</p><p>However,&nbsp;<strong>I am a true Nas super-fan</strong>. And, in terms of lyrical content, flows, and production, it’s great but not his greatest. The instrumental uses a famous piano sample from Ludwig Van Beethoven’s classic “Fur Elise.”</p><p><strong>The lyrics are truly inspirational and immensely positive…&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nas talks about the hidden history of black people and African culture and drops gems on the masses. His intelligent lyrics hit the mark and make you question everything you know about how world history is presented in the West.&nbsp;</p><p>With school kids singing the chorus hook and the message about believing in yourself and living a positive existence, this might be the most socially conscious track he ever wrote.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=10_Live_at_The_BBQ></span><code>#10</code> Live at The BBQ<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In my opinion, this list can’t happen without the inclusion of&nbsp;Live at the BBQ&nbsp;by Main Source&nbsp;featuring Nasty Nas. This is the first time we ever heard Nas rapping on wax. It was obvious from that moment that a star had been born. He smashes the track and obliterates other emcees on the song who were considered some of the best at the time. And Nas was only 19 years old when this track came out.</p><p>The song was originally on Main Source’s classic album,&nbsp;Breaking Atoms. It was the perfect jumping-off point for the Queensbridge native to let the world know who he was. Rap was never the same again after this tune. Furthermore, Main Source and Large Professor don’t get enough praise for introducing us to a future rap legend.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where it all started for Nas. So, it only makes sense that you do your due diligence and go and listen to this tune right away because it’s rap music history 101.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Want_More_Tracks_from_Legendary_Rappers></span>Want More Tracks from Legendary Rappers?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If so, then check out our thoughts on the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Hip Hop Songs Of All Time</a>, the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best 90s Hip Hop Songs</a>, the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best 2000s Rap Songs</a>, the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Lil Wayne Songs of All Time</a>, and the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Snoop Dogg Songs of All Time</a>&nbsp;for more amazing song selections.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Top_10_Nas_Songs_%E2%80%93_Final_Thoughts></span>Top 10 Nas Songs – Final Thoughts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When we talk about the greatest rappers ever, Nas, Biggie Smalls, Tupac, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Casanova Fly, and even Eminem, all get mentioned. I think Nas is the greatest rapper of all time, but I wouldn’t argue if you think otherwise. These sorts of things are highly subjective, so there is no definite answer.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the truth is that most rappers for the ten years after&nbsp;Illmatic&nbsp;was released were influenced by Nas in some way, shape, or form. And you can’t overlook that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>From his debut release in 1994 right up until today…&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nas is still making great music. I’ll concede that his modem day singles and albums can’t live up to most of his 1990s material. But that’s just the way that the music game works. It’s a young man’s game, and they set the trends.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Nas is one of the&nbsp;<strong>most influential rappers of all time</strong>. And his lyrics are considered some of the best ever written by fans and even university professors alike. Pay homage to the rap godson himself, that paved the way for the likes of Jay-Z.</p><p>Until next time, happy listening.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jq2mqWVhZXqvrdJmqqiml6h8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-10-nas-songs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-10-nas-songs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-10-nas-songs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-10-nas-songs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-10-nas-songs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-10-nas-songs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./grinch-christmas-holiday-decorations-tops-amazon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./grinch-christmas-holiday-decorations-tops-amazon.html>Grinch Decorations and Tops for the Holidays Starting at $10</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-alesia.html>Taylor Alesia Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Facts, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-alesia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
