Read on to know more about the talented music artist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CeeLo-Green.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Birth_childhood_and_family></span><span>Birth, childhood, and family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>CeeLo Green’s real name is Thomas DeCarlo Callaway. He is also known as Cee Lo Green.</p><p>Thomas was born on May 30, 1974, in &nbsp;Atlanta, Georgia. Both his parents were ordained ministers. So Thomas had an early opportunity to start a music career in the church.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CeeLo-Green-4.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Education></span><span>Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He graduated high school from a boarding school for boys called Riverside Military Academy located in &nbsp;Gainesville, Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CeeLo-Green-2-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Green%E2%80%99s_father%E2%80%99s_untimely_death></span><span>Green’s father’s untimely death</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sadly, when Thomas was 2 years old, his father died. His mother, Sheila J. Tyler-Callaway, a firefighter was paralyzed in a car crash. She died two years after the accident. Green was 18 then.</p><p>At the time of his mother’s death, Thomas’s career with Goodie Mob had begun taking off. The death of his mother sank him into a deep depression. Later in his successful career, he wrote about it in various songs such as “Free”, “Just a Thought”, “She Knows”, “A Little Better”, &nbsp;“Guess Who”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CeeLo-Green-2.jpg><p>You may like to read <a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Kandi Burruss and her dungeon party!

The song was released on 27 February 2018. The song is produced by Vinny Venditto and YNIGO.</p><p>In the song, the singer gives details of both the good and bad sides of being a street hustler. The song is quite melodic with verses of rap and a very catchy beat. His vocal in the song is very prominent and as I think- soulful.</p><p>“Shot down but I levitate<br>An idle mind starts to contemplate<br>Razor blades making lifelines<br>Now I’m staring at an empty plate”</p><p>“All the best for your dreams, baby<br>Say a prayer, get on your knees, baby<br>Young Lo will make it flip right quick<br>I’ll be God damned if I don’t die rich”</p><p></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marriage_and_fiancee></span><span>Marriage and fiancée&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The former Voice judge likes to keep his personal details private. Not much is known about him, of course except a few facts. He believes keeping relationships private contributes to a successful relationship.</p><p>Green was married to Christina Johnson. The couple had married in 2000. But 5 years into the marriage, their relationship crumbled. The two divorced in 2005. They have a son together, Kingston Johnson, who is now in his late teens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CeeLo-Green-3.jpg><p>CeeLo has been engaged to Shani James in 2015. The couple kept their engagement a secret for a year. Later they revealed out their relationship status to People magazine.</p><p>He had popped the question with a beautiful diamond ring when they were in the studio. Fans were shocked as well as happy to know about the happy couple.</p><p>Also read <a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“Find out all the Event on the Show and the Winner of show ‘The Voice’ Is….” (Edit)">Find out all the Event on the Show and the Winner of the show ‘The Voice’ Is…</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CeeLo-Green-5.jpg><p>Green revealed,</p><p>“I went and purchased a ring that we had seen together, maybe four or five months or so prior.”</p><p>The two have not married yet.</p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
