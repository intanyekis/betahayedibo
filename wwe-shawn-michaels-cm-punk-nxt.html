It seemed a long shot, but <a href=#>no one in WWE has said that they've rule it out</a>. It would definitely be a shocker, but with Punk already having shown up at Raw months ago looking to speak to Triple H, anything seems possible. Many have already pointed out that this year's Survivor Series is set in Punk's hometown in Chicago.</p><p>While we can maybe see Punk on Raw or SmackDown, what if he came back to WWE on another brand? At a media call ahead of this weekend's NXT No Mercy Premium Live Event, Shawn Michaels was asked by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Hausman of Haus of Wrestling</a> if he would sign CM Punk to NXT. “I always enjoy working with Phil. Again, I didn’t get to do it much, but I don’t know. I’ll say this. I understood him. I think there were, whether you want to say there were similarities in us. Look, I can’t lie. He, once again, we were at TV, and he once pulled out of his wallet, right there on the spot, a little autograph that I guess I had apparently signed for him in a hotel that he still had. So, I’ve always liked him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And I understand he’s a different kind of cat and can sometimes be challenging to get along with people, but again, that’s probably why I like him because I suffer from the same thing. So, but still, look, obviously, that’s for people to decide, higher up on the food chain than I am. He’s a guy that does numbers and makes money. I think that would be a risk, reward ratio that I’m sure, from a company standpoint, they’d have to consider, but when it comes to, would we take him in NXT and have him on our television? Are you kidding me? Of course, I would. I just don’t think anybody would let me... Who doesn't take that kind of star power?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>CM Punk Sparks WWE Rumors at CFFC MMA Event After AEW Departure</a></span></p><h2 id=could-cm-punk-in-nxt-be-possible>Could CM Punk In NXT Be Possible?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shawn-michaels-cm-punk-wwe-raw-promo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>If CM Punk returns to WWE</a>, it will most likely be on the biggest stage, in front of the most fans possible. That's what Raw and SmackDown would be. On the surface, NXT makes no sense. It's the smallest of WWE's shows, one that's in front of the least amount of fans, and has the lowest viewership. On top of that, it's mostly a developmental brand.</p><p>CM Punk in NXT could be interesting though. It could be used as a way to make him prove himself before WWE trusts him enough to put him on the main roster. His star power could also be used to make NXT a traveling show rivaling Raw and SmackDown. While the odds of that ever happening seem slim, wrestling lately has repeatedly taught us that anything is possible. If you can imagine it, then it can happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuv8earqdlnZ6wqa3Epapmm51ivba6ymalsaxf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwwe-shawn-michaels-cm-punk-nxt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwwe-shawn-michaels-cm-punk-nxt.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwwe-shawn-michaels-cm-punk-nxt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwwe-shawn-michaels-cm-punk-nxt.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwwe-shawn-michaels-cm-punk-nxt.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwwe-shawn-michaels-cm-punk-nxt.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lucy-bolam.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lucy-bolam.html>Who Is Lucy Bolam?
