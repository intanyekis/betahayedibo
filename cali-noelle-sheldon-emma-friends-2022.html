In addition, we'll also examine what the twins have said about their time on the show many moons ago back in 2003 and 2004.</p><h2 id=cali-and-noelle-were-treated-like-royalty-by-the-cast-of-39-friends-39-during-their-time-as-emma>Cali And Noelle Were Treated Like Royalty By The Cast Of 'Friends' During Their Time As Emma</h2><p>During their time on 'Friends', the cast made it a priority to treat the two little ones as best as possible. The twins spoke about their experience on the show alongside Insider, <a href=#>which all started with a simple ad in a paper.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Someone posted something on there about babies being really good for acting jobs and since we lived close to LA, my mom thought 'that would be kind of cool' and she looked into it, got us a manager I think, and then we got the jobs on 'Friends' shortly after."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Can't Believe One Of Rachel's Ex-Boyfriends On 'Friends' Has Gone Gray These Days</a></span></p><p>Not only was the cast great to the twins but they also recall getting Christmas presents towards the end of the show during its final seasons.</p><p>"All of the cast were super nice to us, they treated us all like little princesses and when we had holidays and stuff, they'd give us little Christmas gifts," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is an experience they'll never forget, especially given that the impact of the sitcom can still be felt to this very day. However, these days, the twins have grown up and moved on since then, looking completely unrecognizable.</p><h2 id=cali-sheldon-was-one-of-the-twins-that-played-emma>Cali Sheldon Was One Of The Twins That Played Emma</h2><p>It might be hard to believe but Cali Sheldon is finishing up her teens these days, at the age of 19. At the moment, she's a student at UCLA and a future graduate.</p><p>The former 'Friends' star also has a few acting credits according to IMDb, appearing in 'Us' back in 2019. She also appeared in a few shorts, including a television show, 'Life'.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fun Bobby Looks Unrecognizable Compared To His Days On 'Friends'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Cali will always have fond memories of her time on 'Friends', posting behind-the-scenes pictures alongside Jennifer Aniston.</p><p>According to Cali, Aniston would also play the role of her mother at the time on-set.</p><p>"One scene when I was sitting on Jennifer Aniston's lap, she had to like feed me because I was making way too many noises, but I never threw up thank god!" Cali said.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see if she pursues acting once her school life is complete but for the time being, she definitely seems to be on the right path, similar to her sister Noelle, who also played Emma on 'Friends' back in the early 2000s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noelle-sheldon-was-the-other-twin-that-played-emma-on-39-friends-39>Noelle Sheldon Was The Other Twin That Played Emma On 'Friends'</h2><p>Like her sister, Noelle is also attending UCLA these days, though the teen is a lot more reserved when it comes to her past on 'Friends'. She doesn't have posts related to the gig, and she hasn't spoken much about the experience, unlike her sister.</p><p>Noelle Sheldon also has a few acting credits, with her most recent dating back to 2019, in 'Us', along with another project in 2019, 'Ham on Rye'. Of course, she began on 'Friends' as a baby, appearing on the show as Emma alongside her sister in 2003 and 2004.</p><p>As it turns out, Noelle and Cali's parents also got in on the fun, attending the cast parties back in the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My parents got to go to all the cast parties and the Christmas party and were always talking to the cast members ... They were just super nice and were just like normal people, not cocky or arrogant or anything," she said.</p><p>It really isn't a surprise to learn how welcoming the cast was, even though the show was a monster TV hit back then, and still is now.</p><p>Who knows, maybe once the twins are done school, they'll find themselves on another popular sitcom.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>What Happened To The Kids Who Played Phoebe's Triplets On 'Friends'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqSZYruwsculnGarmJq5pbvNZpympZFis7O1xKebrGViZX9zew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcali-noelle-sheldon-emma-friends-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcali-noelle-sheldon-emma-friends-2022.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcali-noelle-sheldon-emma-friends-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcali-noelle-sheldon-emma-friends-2022.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcali-noelle-sheldon-emma-friends-2022.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcali-noelle-sheldon-emma-friends-2022.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-idol-finale-lily-rose-depps-jocelyn-unleashes-her-power.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-idol-finale-lily-rose-depps-jocelyn-unleashes-her-power.html>Lily-Rose Depp's Jocelyn unleashes her power</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1236149-paul-wight-rey-fenix-leyla-hirsch.html>Paul Wight Calls Rey Fenix An Incredibly Unique Talent, Says Hes A Fan Of Leyla Hirschs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1236149-paul-wight-rey-fenix-leyla-hirsch.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
