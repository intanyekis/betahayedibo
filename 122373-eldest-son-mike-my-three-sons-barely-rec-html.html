Here's how he looks 60 years after the show.</p><p class=dh>Tim Considine, who is best known for his portrayal of Mike Douglas in the classic series "My Three Sons," is an American actor, writer, photographer, and automotive historian. He was mostly active in the entertainment industry from the late 1950s to the early 1960s.</p><p class=dh>Considine jumpstarted his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175919/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">career</a> by making an appearance on "The Clown" back in 1953. From 1955 to 1957, he starred on Disney shows "Spin and Marty" and "Hardy Boys," which were both 15-minute segments on the "Mickey Mouse Club."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0c9f4b5d28c78096c733f75864b9dff7.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tim Considine attends as The Walt Disney Company hosts a special stage rededication ceremony for Annette Funicello at Walt Disney Studios on June 24, 2013 in Burbank, California.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HIS SHOWBUSINESS CAREER</strong></p><p class=dh>Still, on Disney, he starred in the show "The Swamp Fox" and the movie "The Shaggy Dog." Last but not least, Considine joined the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2019/06/04/my-three-sons-then-and-now-what-the-cast-is-up-to-today/23741824/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM0Vw6Y-OANpONyfVIrJFm2zfK2eG9Wrul3G9Hhwocumw7L7LpgZ43M1VJgft73qZgcCB1Jw1jdBQyoNhnHGVP--SsvKMuFFJCL3HD0Pij8EimnXFi2vj1IwQ31Zf6hH1023dVqaGI01LokAt-u9Rr1mrPnqsVKQB07ysblfxr2o">cast</a> of "My Three Sons" in its first five seasons.</p><p class=dh>Considine's exit from the show was a personal choice, as he had wanted to pursue other projects. Ultimately, the show ran for 12 seasons.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHIFTING GEARS TO FOLLOW HIS PASSION</strong></p><p class=dh>In the next couple of years, he starred in several shows and movies, including the 1970 film "Patton," portraying one of the two shell-shocked soldiers slapped by General S. Patton, Jr. Following this movie, he suddenly shifted careers.</p><p class=dh>He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.boomermagazine.com/tim-considine-my-three-sons/>worked</a> as an automobile historian, photographer, and writer specializing in motorsports. However, during the next five decades, he continued to make mostly small appearances in TV movies and series, with his last role in the 2006 film, "Ray of Sunshine."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HIS LOVE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY</strong></p><p class=dh>“Photography was something I controlled at every stage, and I loved that,” Considine <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.boomermagazine.com/tim-considine-my-three-sons/>revealed</a>. True enough, his photography career took off.</p><p class=dh>He managed to secure a photography project for The National Hockey League, which in turn led to bigger things -- photographing the Stanley Cup playoffs and eventually touring around the globe with football star Pelé.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A WELL-LOVED WRITER</strong></p><p class=dh>Considine's passions for cars, racing, and writing have also brought him plenty of success. Today, as a well-respected automotive historian and an authoritative writer on the subject, he has written numerous books on his passions.</p><p class=dh>His most notable work, "Twice Around the Clock: The Yanks at Le Mans," was released in 2017 and took an astonishing two decades to compile. While he no longer acts, he is still very active in his other professions.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HIS PERSONAL LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh>At 80, Considine is still going strong and lives with his wife of 40 years, Willette Hunt. The couple got married in 1979 following his divorce from his first wife, Charlotte Stewart.</p><p class=dh>Stewart was an actress best known for playing teacher Miss Beadle on "Little House on the Prairie" for four seasons. They were married from 1965 to 1972.</p><p class=dh>Now, <a class="me a" href=#>Considine</a> and Hunt live in Los Angeles and share a child, their son Chris. Despite the former child star's old age, he has no plans to stop working anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmppa2tnaHqmuMOeqq1lo6S7brnIpJxmpaliwam%2BxJ5krKeeqHqjrdGeo7Jlopqwb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f122373-eldest-son-mike-my-three-sons-barely-rec-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f122373-eldest-son-mike-my-three-sons-barely-rec-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f122373-eldest-son-mike-my-three-sons-barely-rec-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f122373-eldest-son-mike-my-three-sons-barely-rec-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f122373-eldest-son-mike-my-three-sons-barely-rec-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f122373-eldest-son-mike-my-three-sons-barely-rec-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-chris-evert-make-latest-chris-evert-net-worth-income-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-chris-evert-make-latest-chris-evert-net-worth-income-salary.html>How Much Money Does Chris Evert Make?
