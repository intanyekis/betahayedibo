However, these people have been repeatedly proven wrong by the couples who have found their soulmates on MTV’s hit reality show, <a href=#>Are You the One</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series, which debuted on television screens in 2014, is based on the use of modern technology to help people find ‘the one’. The show's participants are matched by a special algorithm that computes several compatibility tests and identifies the best matches. The results are kept a secret from the participants, until later in the show and if they choose the same partner as the test, they win the grand prize. But, just how accurate can technology be in matching people? Here are the couples from the show that are still together.</p><h2 id=ethan-and-amber-diamond><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ethan and Amber Diamond</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ethan and Amber are pretty much the dream team that have set the standard for couples who have been on the show since them. The reason for this is that they were matched by the algorithm and have stayed together. Right from their time on Are You the One, down to their almost half a decade of marriage, the pair have shown us just how beautiful love can be.</p><p>Amber and Ethan currently have two kids, Scarlet and Serena. Amber took to her Instagram to make a statement on how she and her soulmate have managed to make things work for so long, she wrote "As the only matched couple that has made it from Are You The One? everyone's always asking what our secret is. Well here it is selflessness," Amber wrote. "You do things to build each other up, not restrict or tear each other down. I always strive to help Ethan reach his potential - and I don't even hesitate to make sacrifices cause I know he'll do the same for me."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Are You The One?': An Update On Perfect Matches From Season One</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenni-knapmiller-and-curtis-hadzicki><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jenni Knapmiller and Curtis Hadzicki</span></h2><p>One thing this couple has taught us is that love doesn't come the same way for everyone. Even though they didn't exactly seem into each other while the second installment of the show was filming, they managed to hit it off after the show. When the reunion time came, the couple announced that they had been dating for a while and were happier than ever. Later in October 2020, they announced to the world that they were getting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engaged</a>.</p><h2 id=mikala-thomas-and-joe-torgerson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mikala Thomas and Joe Torgerson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This pair’s connection was particularly surprising to many fans because they didn't even compete in the same season. However, after both their seasons wrapped up, they became friends and before long, that friendship grew into a relationship. They made it public in 2019, saying "Secrets out.. I wanted to keep this one close to my heart where it was safe, but hiding my relationship for 8 months is long enough." Things got more serious with them as they announced their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engagement </a>in February 2021.</p><h2 id=uche-nwosu-and-clinton-moxam><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Uche Nwosu and Clinton Moxam</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Uche and Clinton met in the sixth season of the show, and almost immediately, they struck up a deep connection. The fire of desire was burning so much that they struggled to keep their hands off of each other. However, things hit a curb for some time when the truth booth revealed that they were not matched by the algorithm. Uche and Clinton didn't let technology tell them what to do, as they got back together after the show and in the reunion, Clinton asked her to officially be his girlfriend. Later in 2020, they announced their engagement, and in a year, they were officially revealed to be husband and wife.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Romances That Have Come From MTV's 'The Challenge'</a></span></p><h2 id=cam-bruckman-and-carolina-duarte><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cam Bruckman and Carolina Duarte</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season four’s Cam and Carolina found true love in each other right from the onset show. Although most details of their life together are off social media, the pair seem to still be going at it strong.</p><h2 id=kareem-fathalla-and-alivia-hunter><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kareem Fathalla and Alivia Hunter</span></h2><p>Kareem and Alivia, from season six, were never actually confirmed to not be a match because they keep dating on and off all through the show. Later, when the reunion was held, not only was it revealed that the pair had been together for a while post-show, it was also revealed that Kareem had cheated on Alivia with Zoe Pugh. Things got even more interesting when Alivia revealed that she had also been texting Keith Klebacher for a while. They split up shortly after but then eventually<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> got back together</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Couples From ‘Survivor’ Are Still Together Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shannon-duffy-and-anthony-martin><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Shannon Duffy and Anthony Martin</span></h2><p>At the end of season five, Shannon was heartbroken when she didn’t win the grand prize and it was somewhat because she had chosen to stay with Tyler O’Brien, a no match. A while after, Shannon’s friend, Dimitri introduced her to Anthony Martin and then the pair hooked up. In 2020, Shannon and Anthony welcome their first child Isabella and appear to still be together.</p><h2 id=cali-trepp-and-tomas-buenos><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cali Trepp and Tomas Buenos</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Cali and Tomas met in season seven, they were instantly attracted to each other, so much so that they started dating during the first week of the show. Later, they found out that they had been paired with other people and decided to explore that line during the final three weeks in the house. Although they found the match chosen for them by the algorithm, they decided to follow their hearts and announced their relationship during the reunion.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Which 'Marrying Millions' Couples Are Still Together?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51drry2edOhnGannpp6pLvUqaOeq12owaq4y2arqJ%2BVqbWmvoyumqGdXaPEsL%2FUZpqloZ6pvK95zKivmqVf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-you-the-one-couples-still-together-uche-nwosu-clinton-moxam.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-you-the-one-couples-still-together-uche-nwosu-clinton-moxam.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-you-the-one-couples-still-together-uche-nwosu-clinton-moxam.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-you-the-one-couples-still-together-uche-nwosu-clinton-moxam.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-you-the-one-couples-still-together-uche-nwosu-clinton-moxam.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-you-the-one-couples-still-together-uche-nwosu-clinton-moxam.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./achraf-hakimi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./achraf-hakimi.html>Achraf Hakimi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-sherry-morrow-everything-on-cory-morrow-wife-age-and-children-241631-html.html>Who Is Sherry Morrow?
