Believe us, it’s really good.</p><h3><strong>Ben Affleck Workout Routine and Diet Plan for Batman vs. Superman</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ben-Affleck-workout.jpg><h3><strong>The Big Plan</strong></h3><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ben Affleck</a> or your own Batman prepared for the film with the help of Walter Norton Jr. who trained him for The Town (2010) too. To prepare for the role, he consulted with the film director, <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Zack Snyder</a> and they decided that Ben should not look like he did in The Town. They wanted him to look bigger, reports&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Cosmic Book News</a>.</p><h3><strong>The Joke</strong></h3><p>Someone in the studio even joked that he could look like young&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and they all enjoyed the joke because we all know&nbsp;Arnold has the best body of all time and Ben couldn’t have&nbsp;mastered that so easily. They finally settled on making him look like an MMA heavyweight fighter.</p><h3><strong>Workout Routine</strong></h3><p>The exercise routine&nbsp;involved working out for 90 minutes to 2.5 hours in a day for 15 months and that too 6 days in a row with two rest days before the next 6 days started. The workout timing was not set. They worked out late at nights or sometimes as early as&nbsp;5 in the morning. The body they were aiming for was to have a powerful and physically imposing look. They hit the weight room day after day and took the entire body transformation as a process.</p><h3><strong>The Workout Location</strong></h3><p>The workout location of the talented actor was a three car garage that was turned into a gym by using a hybrid program. The hybrid program included functional movements and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>bodybuilding exercises</a>. They did joint friendly exercises as the workouts were supposed to last for long. They also did muscle building exercises. Affleck was best at doing pull-ups, inverted rows, and chin-ups.</p><h3><strong>The Result</strong></h3><p>The result of the hard work was that The Gone Girl (2014) actor added some weight on his glutes and legs for the first time. He got a better body frame and well toned as well as big calves.</p><h3><strong>Diet Plan</strong></h3><p>The diet plan of the Pearl Harbor (2001) actor was designed by famous nutritionist Rehan Jalali. His diet plan began with having <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>egg</a> whites and oatmeal in the breakfast. He ate vegetables and salad at lunch and had fish or chicken in dinner which was accompanied by broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. He followed the diet to the letter and didn’t make any exceptions.</p><p>To check out the previous fitness&nbsp;routine and diet of Ben Affleck, just check this <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>article</a>.</p><h3><strong>Henry Cavill Workout Routine and Diet Plan</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Henry-Cavill-Superman-shirtless-body.jpg><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Henry Cavill</a> was so serious about his role in the film that he spent the Christmas holiday at the gym. He was training a lot, eating a lot and got 9-hour sleep. He worked with his Man of Steel (2013) trainer Mark Twight and his aims were to look bigger and stronger. He also wanted to look bigger than Batman and the general consensus was in favor of it too. He shared his aims with the Snyder and Twight. They both agreed to it.</p><h3><strong>Diet Plan</strong></h3><p>The diet of The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015) star included 5000 calories in a day which was in line with his training sessions. He ate clean foods and loved it too because he had latitude.</p><h3><strong>Workout Routine</strong></h3><p>The versatile actor spent two exhausting hours in the gym and the workouts helped him to increase his measurables. Six months into the training in the film and he was able to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>deadlift</a> about 500 pounds and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>front squatted</a> 335 pounds.</p><p>The workout aimed&nbsp;at having&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>broad shoulders</a> and a narrow waist. He did exercises like tumbles, handstands, and gymnastics work for achieving these goals. The workout schedule&nbsp;was not only limited to physical training. It involved some psychological training as well because he needed to be confident enough to lift heavier weights.</p><p>To get a better idea about the exercises he did for the role and how you can do them too, check out this <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>link</a>.</p><h3><strong>The Result</strong></h3><p>The result of all these efforts was very good. From a psychological point of view, the actor was willing to take a little bit more of an aggressive attitude towards the weights, he was lifting. He also became more physically equipped for the training. From the physical point of view, he achieved the 220-pound goal and usually had 202 pounds with 7 or 8 percent body fat only.</p><h3><strong>The Comparison</strong></h3><p>When his weight performance was compared with his performance in Man of Steel, the efforts he put in for and the results he got from training for Batman vs. Superman are way better. He gained an extra 12 pound of muscle for the latter role and looked bigger than ever.</p><h3><strong>Gal Gadot Training for Wonder Woman</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gal-Gadot-workout.jpg><p>When Batman and Superman are gaining weight for their roles, how can the Wonder Woman lag behind. The actress, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Gal Gadot</a> underwent training for 9 months for the role. She spent 3 months with Twight one on one in Tel Aviv. The training was immensely satisfying and challenging. Gadot was so determined to look great in the movie that she didn’t object to letting go of her slender figure and agree to add a significant amount of weight to her body. The weight gain helped the beauty to transform her self-image and body image quite a lot.</p><h3><strong>Going Slowly</strong></h3><p>The former fashion model changed herself by taking incremental steps. She took things slowly and once she got comfortable with a new thing like high jumping, only then Twight made the things harder.</p><h3><strong>Workout Routine</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gal-Gadot-working-out.jpg><p>A few months back, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>InStyle</a> reported that the fitness session&nbsp;of the diva included squats, ball throws, and basic pull-ups with cardio intervals using the rowing machine and a stationary bike. She did these with two minutes of full-force that was followed by two minutes of active rest. The workout also involved participating in several weight-lifting challenges regularly.</p><h3><strong>Diet Plan</strong></h3><p>Hayley Bradley also helped Gadot to get in great shape. He had her balancing each meal with equal amounts of greens and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>protein</a>. He also advised her to stay away from green juices as they can have too many calories that come from large amounts of natural sugars that are present in almost all fruits and veggies. He also told her to drink a gallon of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>water</a> on a daily basis. It helped the actress to feel fuller and reduced her habit of snacking. Staying hydrated also helped her to boost her endurance.</p><h3><strong>The Result</strong></h3><p>The results of her efforts were shared by the stunner herself in a recent chat with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Glamour</a>. She told everyone that she gained 17 pounds for the role and all the weight she gained is pure muscle. She feels stronger and likes her new body. She thinks that feeling stronger has helped her improve her posture and the way she walks. Now, whenever she looks at her pictures from 5 years back, she thinks that she was way too skinny and it was not cool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Batman-V-Superman-stars-signing-autographs-at-Comic-Con.jpg><p>Don’t you think that all the actors have really put their hearts and souls in the movie?
