Pava LaPere built a successful software company that gave her national visibility as well as local political power.</strong></p><p>Despite this, she never lost sight of what had inspired her from the beginning: making connections, establishing community, and utilizing business to effect significant social change. Loved ones recalled LaPere as a bundle of vim and ambition with an unflinching optimism in the human capacity for positive change in the days following her horrible death from what authorities believe was a random assault at her Baltimore apartment complex.</p><p>During a vigil on Wednesday night, they vowed to honor her legacy by working hard and being kind to others. The 26-year-old entrepreneur and recent Johns Hopkins graduate’s body was discovered late Monday morning with blunt force trauma. She’d gone missing not long ago. People are curious about Pava Lapere’s parents and family, so read on to learn more.</p><h2>Pava LaPere’s Parents and Family: Frank LaPere, Father, and Mother</h2><p>LaPere, EcoMap’s CEO and co-founder, was a rising star in the IT business. At the time, she was 26 years old. Frank LaPere, her father, spoke about his daughter’s death and the impact she had on social media. Pava LaPere’s parents are Frank (the father) and Caroline LaPere. Despite the fact that Pava LaPere is currently making headlines, we do not know his parents’ names, dates of birth, ages, or occupation.</p><p>Her friends and family are still puzzled as to how she lived and died. “Pava has inspired so many people,” stated Frank LaPere. She was driven, innovative, thorough, and tenacious in her efforts while working with her outstanding EcoMap Technologies team. According to Frank LaPere, his daughter will be “forever missed as a daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin, and loyal friend.”</p><p>According to Kory Bailey, Pava was a genius at bringing people together. Bailey went on to say, “She made it her life’s work to bring people together, and I miss her.” According to LaPere’s family, they “lost a deeply loved daughter, sister, and friend who could understand all of us in a way that no other human being could.”</p><h2>Family Mourns The Loss</h2><p>She left an impression on everyone she came into contact with. We have lost a beloved daughter, sister, and friend who was the only one who truly understood us all. Pava saw every one of us as distinct and worthwhile, and he had a unique perspective on our lives. Pava’s counsel and reflection helped all of us gain perspective and the determination to continue in the face of adversity.</p><p>We are still stunned and unable to grasp Pava’s death. Only in the peaceful hours of life will the entire extent of this catastrophe become obvious after the dust settles. Pava’s realistic optimism should be emulated by the rest of us. The Ecomap team, the City of Baltimore, and the global entrepreneurial community are all to blame for the loss.</p><p>Pava dedicated her entire life, her talent, and her unwavering work ethic to our mutual improvement. Pava moved to Baltimore to study at Johns Hopkins University, where she worked tirelessly to develop her vision for the city. She admired Baltimore and its people, as well as its potential, art, architecture, and history.</p><p>There was no better embodiment of the city’s greatest attributes. Pava, you will be much missed. Numerous joyful memories and the knowledge that the effect you left here in your brief time will continue on for future generations give us peace of mind.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>CEO</a> <a href=# rel=tag>co founder</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>William Addison</a></h3>William Addison estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
