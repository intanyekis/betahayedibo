Virginia was also a political asylee in the United States of America. On 18 July 2006, the DEA took her out of Colombia in a special flight to save her life and cooperate with the Department of Justice in high-profile cases.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=virginia-vallejo-age-how-old-is-virginia-vallejo></span><span>Virginia Vallejo Age: How Old Is Virginia Vallejo?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vallejo was Born on August 26, 1949, in Cartago, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. She is currently 70 years old as of 2019. Vallejo celebrates her birthday on August 26.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=virginia-vallejo-parents-and-education></span><span>Virginia Vallejo Parents and Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Virginia was the oldest of the four children of Juan Vallejo Jaramillo and Mary García Rivera. Her father was an entrepreneur. Her family was not only financially well-off but was also politically powerful.</p><p>Her grandfather, Eduardo Vallejo Varela, was a minister of economy in the Colombian government from April 12, 1930, to 7 August. Her grandmother, Sofía Jaramillo Arango, could trace her family back to Alonso Jaramillo de Andrade Céspedes y Guzmán, a nobleman from Extremadura, Spain, who could trace his own lineage back to Emperor Charlemagne.</p><p>In 1950, Vallejo and her parents moved back to Bogotá, where the births of her younger siblings, brothers Felipe (1951) and Antonio (1955-2012), and sister Sofía (1957), occurred.<br>She began her education at the kindergarten run by President Carlos Lleras Restrepo’s sister, Elvira Lleras Restrepo.</p><p>She then went on to study at the Anglo Colombian School, an institution with which she has a personal connection. It was co-founded by her great-uncle Jaime Jaramillo Arango, who was a professor of medicine and surgery, author, diplomat, and politician.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=virginia-vallejo-pablo-escobar-virginia-vallejo-interview></span><span>Virginia Vallejo Pablo Escobar: Virginia Vallejo Interview</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vallejo interviewed drug lord and narco-terrorist Pablo Escobar in January 1983 and was the first journalist to have the dubious honor. Filmed at the Medellín garbage dump, the interview garnered criticism as people thought that it humanized Escobar who, during the interview, extensively talked about his charity project Medellín Sin Tugurios (Medellin without slums).</p><p>Prior to the interview, Escobar was a minor celebrity in his country. In 1982, despite being married at the time, he reportedly declared “I want her” after seeing Vallejo on television. They met later that year and eventually became lovers. Escobar already had a reputation for his ruthlessness and bloody lifestyle. However, he could be charming and had a sense of humor. These were the qualities Vallejo found herself attracted to</p><p>As for Escobar, the relationship proved to be a useful one. The interview made him a national phenomenon. He became so popular that the newspapers started calling him “the Robin Hood of Medellín”. Whether Escobar had true feelings for Vallejo is a matter of debate. Many believed that he was simply using her to elevate himself to the national stage.</p><p>In 1987, Vallejo’s relationship with Escobar came to an end. Escobar’s son has claimed that his father cut all his ties with Vallejo after finding out that he was not her only lover. He recounted the last time he saw her. She was outside the gate of one of their estates, sobbing, while the guards of her erstwhile lover did not let her into the compound.</p><p>By the early 1990s. Escobar’s popularity and fame had considerably decreased. Vallejo did not fare any better. Escobar had a symbiotic relationship with the elites of his country. They would take his money and ignore all his illegal activities. These elites shunned her completely and she eventually vanished from the public specter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=virginia-vallejo-death-is-virginia-vallejo-dead></span><span>Virginia Vallejo Death: Is Virginia Vallejo Dead?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During her time with Escobar, Vallejo had witnessed his interactions with the Colombian elites. In July 2006, the former senator and justice minister Alberto Santofimio, who served as the link between Escobar and the Colombian ruling class, was being tried because of the conspiracy in the assassination of the presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán.</p><p>Vallejo came forward and agreed to give her testimony to Attorney General Iguarán but the presiding judge and the Inspector General Maya Villazón immediately shut down the case. Realizing the danger she was in, Vallejo reached out to the US embassy, asking for protection.</p><p>In return, she promised that she would give them all the information she had on the Mower family and on the connection between the Cali cartel bosses and people in the Colombian government. She left Colombia for Miami in a special flight arranged by the DEA, arriving on July 18, 2006. She was eventually granted political asylum in the US on June 3, 2010.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=virginia-vallejo-facts-and-body-measurements></span><span>Virginia Vallejo Facts and Body Measurements</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Virginia Vallejo García</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>70 years (2019)</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>August 26, 1949</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>Cartago, Valle del Cauca, Colombia</li><li><strong>Nationality:&nbsp;</strong>Colombian</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>: Author and Journalist</li><li><strong>Known For</strong>: Interviewing Pablo Escobar</li><li><strong>Net worth</strong>: $15 Million</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=virginia-vallejo-husband-virginia-vallejo-marriages></span><span>Virginia Vallejo Husband: Virginia Vallejo Marriages</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Vallejo was 19 or 20 years old, she married for the first time.
