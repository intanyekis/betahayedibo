Only when they find out their real age, they realize time has passed by, and they've grown old, as have their favorite people.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here is a list of celebrities over 80 whose age rarely comes&nbsp;to our attention, and also their then and now comparison in pictures. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>Patrick Stewart</h3><p>Real name: Patrick Stewart</p><p>Age/birthday: 81 (July 13, 1940)</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Most famous for: playing Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek, Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men movies, and the narrator in Ted <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Patrick-Stewart-Then-and-Now.jpg></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Patrick Stewart</a>&nbsp;is one of those veteran actors who shows no signs of slowing down.</p><p>There are few things Stewart has done and not excelled at. He has conquered Shakespearean theater, movies, TV shows, and even voice acting. He has even sung a few tunes here and there.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2022, he famously reprised his role as Professor Charles Xavier in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and is a series regular as Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: Picard. On the voice acting front, he voices Avery Bullock in American Dad! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>Al Pacino</h3><p>Real name: Alfredo James Pacino</p><p>Age/birthday: 82 (April 25, 1940)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Most famous for: playing Michael Corleone in The Godfather film series, Jimmy Hoffa in The Irishman, Tony Montana in Scarface <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Al-Pacino-Then-and-Now.jpg><p>One of the most iconic actors of his generation, <a href=# rel=follow>Al Pacino</a> has been behind many of the greatest movies of all time. He has worked with many iconic directors and portrayed a few icons himself, and made a few characters icons themselves. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Pacino isn't done yet, though. Upcoming is King Lear, a classic Shakespearean tale in which he will play the titular role, and Sniff, which will see him portray Harvey Stride.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3>Chuck Norris</h3><p>Real name: Carlos Ray Norris</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Age/birthday: 82 (March 10, 1940)</p><p>Most famous for: martial arts expertise, playing the villain in Bruce Lee's Way of the Dragon, internet meme</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Chuck-Norris-Then-and-Now.jpg><p>Chuck Norris is one of the OG macho guys in Hollywood, if not THE OG. Norris began his career training celebrities in martial arts and had only appeared in a handful of movies, like Bruce Lee's Way of the Dragon (on a special request from Lee himself). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, it was at the request of Steve McQueen in 1977&nbsp;that he took acting seriously. And that turned out to be a brilliant move as he became a revered action star whose action movie career lasted till 2012. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That year, he appeared alongside Sylvester Stallone in The Expendables 2&nbsp;and has since not done any movies. He does, however, appear in TV shows, documentaries, and product endorsements here and there.</p><p>Now, he uses Instagram to promote products and also lives in the minds of people rent-free through memes about super strength and amazing physical feats on the internet.</p><h3>Ian McKellen</h3><p>Real name: Ian Murray McKellen</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Age/birthday: 83 (May 23, 1939)</p><p>Most famous for: playing Richard III in Richard III, Magneton in the X-Men movies, and Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Ian-McKellen-Then-and-Now.jpg></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Ian McKellen</a> has a career that is spread over 70 years, during which he has done both theater and cinematic productions. And he is taking no name of slowing down. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As of June 2022, he has three projects yet to come out, including The Critic, which he is filming. He is showing signs of aging, though, as he worked in only one movie in 2021 â€” Infinitum: Subject Unknown.</p><h3>Jane Fonda</h3><p>Real name: Jane Seymour Fonda</p><p>Age/birthday: 84 (December 21, 1937) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Most famous for: playing Bree Daniels in Klute, Coming Home, for her cameo as Brenda Morel in Youth, Grace Hanson in Grace and Frankie<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Jane-Fonda-Then-and-Now.jpg></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Jane Fonda</a> started both her Broadway and screen acting the same year in 1960. She has since won two Academy Awards and many other accolades.</p><p>In 1991, she retired from acting and instead turned to <a href=# rel=follow>make fitness videos</a>. However, acting never left her, and in 2005, she returned to the screens. Thereafter, she has done both simultaneously, along with activism and modeling on the side.</p><p>As of June 2022, she just completed her seven-year, 94-episode stint as Grace Hanson in Grace and Frankie, and is set to appear in four upcoming projects, one of which will see her voice-acting.</p><h3>Anthony Hopkins</h3><p>Real name: Philip Anthony Hopkins</p><p>Age/birthday: 84 (December 31, 1937)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Most famous for: playing Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, Odin in Marvel's Thor</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Anthony-Hopkins-Then-and-Now.jpg><p>Even if you could not say that <a href=# rel=follow>Anthony Hopkins</a> has aged like fine wine physically, his talent has certainly <a href=# rel=follow>stood the test of time</a> well. The man who made Hannibal Lecter a pop-culture phenomenon is still working, still delivering mind-blowing performances in his 80s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Most notably in recent years, he appeared in The Father and won an Oscar for his portrayal of a man losing grip on reality because of dementia, becoming the oldest actor to date to win the coveted prize, and appeared in Westworld, a confusing yet brilliant HBO series.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>He's still going strong and has already worked on three projects in 2022, with three more in the pipeline.</p><h3>George Takei</h3><p>Real name: Hosato Takei</p><p>Age/birthday: 85 (April 20, 1937)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Most famous for: playing Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/George-Takei-Then-and-Now.jpg><p>Like Stewart, <a href=# rel=follow>George Takei</a>, too, gained the most fame for being a part of the original Star Trek cast. He portrayed Hikaru Sulu alongside Stewart.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Since then, however, he has devoted more time to social activism and politics rather than acting. He has been an open advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and for peace.</p><p>That, though, doesn't mean he has completely given up acting. He is still involved in voice-acting roles. He can be seen (or heard) in Hit-Money, Love Monster, and Blue Eyed Samurai, the latter of which is in pre-production as of this writing.</p><h3>Morgan Freeman</h3><p>Real name: Morgan Freeman</p><p>Age/birthday: 85 (June 1, 1937)</p><p>Most famous for: his distinctive, universally recognizable voice, playing Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding on The Shawshank Redemption, Nelson Mandela in Invictus, and Lucius Fox in The Dark Knight trilogy</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Morgan-Freeman-Then-and-Now.jpg><p><a href=# rel=follow>Morgan Freeman</a> has been a part of more iconic movies than anyone could care to count, not to mention how just his voice&nbsp;makes some of his work unforgettable. His presence alone in a project can turn the fate&nbsp;of the said project.</p><p>At 85, Free is far from slowing down or entering the twilight of his career. As of this writing, he has seven projects in the works â€” Paradise Highway is the movie you can watch him in next.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>Jack Nicholson</h3><p>Real name: John Joseph Nicholson</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>Age/birthday: 85 (April 22, 1937)</p><p>Most famous for: playing Jack Torrance in The Shining,&nbsp;Colonel Nathan Jessup in A Few Good Men</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Jack-Nicholson-Then-and-Now.jpg><p>Jack Nicholson is the first actor on this list who has now retired. The actor, who has had a brilliant career behind him, still holds a few records to his name.</p><p>He is the most nominated male actor in the Academy's history, with 12 nominations and three Academy Awards wins, becoming only one of three male actors to do so. Further, he is also only one of the two actors to have been nominated for an Academy Award for acting in movies in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p>However, Nicholson ended his acting career in 2010, with How Do You Know being the last movie he ever worked in.</p><h3>Maggie Smith</h3><p>Real name: Margaret Natalie Smith</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><p>Age/birthday: 87 (December 28, 1934)</p><p>Most famous for: playing Professor Minerva McGonagall in the <a href=# rel=follow>Harry Potter</a> film series</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Maggie-Smith-Then-and-Now.jpg><p>Even though <a href=# rel=follow>Maggie Smith</a> is mostly known for her portrayal of the&nbsp;stern-yet-soft Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter series, she had a brilliant acting career only a few can dream of matching even before that.</p><p>Smith is one of the few people to have received The Triple Crown of Acting â€” two Academy Awards, a Tony Award, and four Primetime Emmy Awards.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_14"></span><p>In recent years, she <a href=# rel=follow>hasn't been</a>&nbsp;actively pursuing roles, but that doesn't mean she has stopped. After appearing on <a href=# rel=follow>Downtown Abbey: A New Era</a> in 2022, she is now working on The Miracle Club and A German Life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span><h3>Rita Moreno</h3><p>Real name: Rosa Dolores Alverio Marcano</p><p>Age/birthday: 90 (December 11, 1931)</p><p>Most famous for: playing Anita in West Side Story (1961), Millie in The Electric Company, Louise in Carnal Knowledge</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Rita-Moreno-Then-and-Now.jpg><p><a href=# rel=follow>Rita Moreno</a> made her name during the Golden Age of Hollywood and now remains the only few alive stars from that era. She is an EGOT winner and has also achieved the Triple Crown of Acting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>The iconic actress is now busy with Fast X, and voice-over work on My Father's Dragon, having just released her documentary film,&nbsp;Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It,&nbsp;and appeared on a 2021 reboot of West Side Story, where she played a newly created character, Valentina.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_18"></span><h3>James Earl Jones</h3><p>Real name: James Earl Jones</p><p>Age/birthday: 91 (January 17, 1931)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_20"></span><p>Most famous for: providing the voice for Darth Vader in the <a href=# rel=follow>Star Wars</a> movies</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_17"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/James-Earl-Jones-Then-and-Now.jpg><p>James Earl Jones, one of the few EGOT winners, is a man whose acting career spans over six decades. He began his career in theater and later translated his success there to success in the movie and TV industry.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><p>Known for his universally recognizable voice, he is still active in the industry. While most of his recent work has been voicing Darth Vader in various animated shows, he has also been doing acting here and there. His latest work is 2022's Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p><h3>William Shatner</h3><p>Real name: William Alan Shatner</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_18"></span><p>Age/birthday: 91 (March 22, 1931)</p><p>Most famous for: playing James T.

Other than acting, he has also written a few books, recorded three studio albums, and even flew to space at 90, becoming the oldest person to do so.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p>Even though he is 91, he is still actively taking part in various charity events and is about to release a new book. On the acting front, he has been doing minor roles here and there and has two upcoming projects.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_23"></span><h3>Clint Eastwood</h3><p>Real name: Clinton Eastwood Jr.</p><p>Age/birthday: 92 (May 31, 1930)</p><p>Most famous for: playing the titular character of&nbsp;Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars trilogy, Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry, Frankie Dunn in Million Dollar Baby</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_19"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Clint-Eastwood-Then-and-Now.jpg><p><a href=# rel=follow>Clint Eastwood</a> was arguably the first actor to truly become a cultural icon of masculinity, primarily through his antihero character in A Fistful of Dollars trilogy. However, it wasn't his acting that got him a few Oscars but his directing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><p>He is one of the few actors to have gotten the Academy Award for directing. And it's not just the entertainment business he is successful at, either.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_25"></span><p>Eastwood became the 30th Mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1986 and remained so until 1988. After this short break, he got back to making movies again.</p><p>His latest works include 2021's Cry Macho and 2018's The Mule. There are no upcoming works under his name for now, but he's certainly not done yet.</p><h3>Tippi Hedren</h3><p>Real name: Nathalie Kay Hedren</p><p>Age/birthday: 92 (January 19, 1930)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_26"></span><p>Most famous for: making movies with Alfred Hitchcock, modeling success in the 1950s, Roar<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Tippi-Hedren-Then-and-Now.jpg><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_14"></span></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Tippi Hedren</a> never thought she would become an actress. She was a model first and even rejected many film roles in her years as a successful model in the 1950s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_27"></span><p>However, fate had greater things for her, and she worked with two of the greatest directors the world has ever seen â€” Alfred Hitchcock and Charlie Chaplin. And she would become the one to pass on her talents to <a href=# rel=follow>Dakota Johnson</a>.</p><p>Hedren has definitely slowed down in her acting endeavors, with a voice acting part in Something Horrible being her last acting gig. However, she is still active in other fields like animal rights activism and running her non-profit for tigers and lions, the Roar Foundation.</p><h3>Bob Newhart</h3><p>Real name: George Robert Newhart</p><p>Age/birthday: 92 (September 5, 1929)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_28"></span><p>Most famous for: The Bob Newhart Show, portraying Professor Proton on The Big Bang Theory<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/hmalbum/Bob-Newhart-Then-and-Now.jpg><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Bob Newhart</a> first began his journey in show business as a comedian.
