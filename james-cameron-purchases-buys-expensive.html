James Cameron currently has a net worth of $800 million. So, without further ado, here are 10 insanely expensive things the movie director has bought.Well, maybe not all of them (the watch was a gift).</p><h2 id=a-mansion>A Mansion</h2><p>Cameron owns a lavish home where he and his wife, Suzy Amis live with their four children, Josephine, Quinn, Claire, and Elizabeth. The mansion, which is located in Malibu, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a>, covers an area of more than 8,000 square feet with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a guest house, a gourmet kitchen, an interior garden, a tennis court, two swimming pools, courtyard, and an indoor cinema.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of Camila Cabello’s Most Expensive Outfits</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron also has a built-in home office within his mansion which includes a private studio for his work. The mansion is said to have cost the movie director $5 million. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2007 he listed the house for over $24 million.</a></p><h2 id=a-winery---2-9-million>A Winery - $2.9 Million</h2><p>The director owns a private winery in the Comox Valley, British Columbia. The winery covers a total of 84 acres. The establishment was the winner of the Northwest Wine Summit in Oregon, the All Canadian Wine Championships and 27 medals at the International Wine Challenge in <a href=#>London</a>. Understandably named Cameron Winery they produce wine using sustainable methods. The winery started some years ago and was recently bought by James Cameron for $2.9 million. The winery whose location was also named a PGA Tour Canada qualifying school site is rumored to be a home base for him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He has been producing his wine since 1984.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-home---20-million>A Home - $20 Million</h2><p>Besides his Malibu mansion, Cameron boasts of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a home in New Zealand</a> which is considered an away home for him, though he had plans of moving there with his family for an indefinite amount of time. The property is divided into two, covering a total of over 1,000 acres, featuring several bedrooms, bathrooms, a kitchen, home offices, and living rooms. The total of this massive property cost the movie director $20 million and is located near Wellington. Though a lot of people, especially New Zealanders tend to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worry concerning his ability to inhabit this massive property</a>, Cameron is not wavered by any of those.</p><h2 id=submarines---3-million>Submarines - $3 Million</h2><p><a href=#>James Cameron</a> owns a fleet of Triton submarines that he bought when he was shooting the movie <i>Titanic</i>. They were used to explore the deep ocean to recover artifacts from the wreckage of the real Titanic, and possibly discover something new. Though he used a different power diver to explore the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench, all his underwater shots were aided by his Triton submarines. Each submarine cost him an average of $3 million. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The movie director embarked on a </a>mission to the point in the pacific called the ‘Challenger Deep’ in 2012. Tritons can dive an astounding 36,000 feet and can carry up to three occupants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-yacht---17--20-million>A Yacht - $17-$20 Million</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron owns an Alucia 2 yacht</a>. James Cameron is not only a record-breaking movie director but has also become popular in ocean exploration and globetrotting, so he bought an Alucia 2 yacht. It was built in 2010 and he equipped the water mover with every scientific technology he would require for his ocean explorations and personal vacations.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Films Helena Bonham Carter Starred In (& How Much They Made)</a></span></p><p>The equipment includes an array of advanced camera systems for capturing the deep blue in great detail. It was for shooting the BBC’s<i> Blue Planet</i>. The yacht also has a helipad and can launch submersibles, tow sonar machines and drag nets. The Alucia 2 costs between $17 million to $20 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-sports-car---36-000--55-000>A Sports Car - $36,000-$55,000</h2><p>Cars are quite expensive, what’s more, they become even more so when they are sports cars and a lot of celebrities are fond of purchasing insanely expensive cars. We all know of cars that cost a fortune, with the Bugatti and Ferrari being just a few. Cameron’s Corvette C6 Convertible isn’t about to be left behind in the expense discussion. With a $2,000 optional folding roof, this powerhouse can range between $36,000 to $55,000 depending on the additional props you chose. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2020 model, mid-Engine Corvette Stingray costs as much as $60,000</a>. The Corvette C6 convertible is the 6th generation of Corvette cars, with specified models being ZR1 and 427 Convertible.</p><h2 id=harley-davidson---19-000--28-000>Harley Davidson - $19,000-$28,000</h2><p>James owns three Harley’s. His these motorcycles make use of the 45-degree air cooled V-Twins, and can reach a mind-blowing speed. To let you know just how fast these machines can go, the record Harley Davidson top speed was 332.15 mph and has been unbroken for the past 16 years. Quite a frightening speed to move on a motorbike. One of his Harleys was featured in the movie <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day!</i><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harley Davisons can cost between $19,000 to a little over $28,000.</a> Harley’s model Comic Starship is the 2nd most expensive motorcycle in the world. Even multi-millionaires deserve to feel the wind in their hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-watch---13-000>A Watch - $13,000</h2><p>James Cameron’s <a href=#>Rolex</a> Deepsea watch was valued at $13,000. In the 21st century, Rolex (being one of the most expensive wristwatch brands) has not been so adventurous when it comes to product reputation and development and only a few people get to have their own branded Rolex. James Cameron is one of those few. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Made in honor of him and his new film</a>, it was released in 2014 with a customized dial that starts from blue and goes down to black in a gradient to commemorate a special event where the movie director went to the deepest part of the deep blue.</p><h2 id=another-motorcycle>Another Motorcycle!</h2><p>James obviously has a love for motorcycles. Maybe it’s the danger involved in the riding of these machines he enjoys (after all he is known for directing famous danger-filled movies), whatever it is we will never know until we ask him. The Ducati 848 EVO owned by James Cameron, weighs about 60 pounds with a speed of up to 356km/h (159 mph). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ducati 848 EVO</a> is one of the fastest motorcycles in the world. The Ducati also boasts another model, the Ducati 1098 that can run at a speed of 169 mph (271 km/h) and is the 10th fastest in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=new-zealand-farms>New Zealand Farms</h2><p>Apart from his two other properties which were listed above, Cameron has spent millions expanding his estate in <a href=#>New Zealand</a>. The dairy farm covers around 250 hectares and was sold to the movie director by Heather and Rob McCreary. James also holds New Zealand residency and is reported to have plans of working on the Avatar sequels soon (using the property of course). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The director is a vegan and an activist at that.</a> He has turned the dairy into a farm for crops, campaigning for moving away from meat and planting vegetables. He believes that moving to crops can help New Zealand’s dairy industry as the country moves to a low-emissions country.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Celebrity Weddings</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8mapJ6rXZiurrHRqKVmqKWnsKmt0p6qZpqlrsBusdepnKermauycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-cameron-purchases-buys-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-cameron-purchases-buys-expensive.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-cameron-purchases-buys-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-cameron-purchases-buys-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-cameron-purchases-buys-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-cameron-purchases-buys-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aishah-hasnie-journalist-wiki-bio-height-weight-age-net-worth-boyfriend-religion-career-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aishah-hasnie-journalist-wiki-bio-height-weight-age-net-worth-boyfriend-religion-career-facts.html>Aishah Hasnie (Journalist) Wiki, Bio, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Religion, Career, F</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-jane-by-jefferson-airplane.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: Jane by Jefferson Airplane</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-jane-by-jefferson-airplane.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
